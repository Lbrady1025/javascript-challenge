# JavaScript Challenge

The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript and the d3 library to filter down on data based on a date entered into a field on a website. The [data](https://github.com/Lbrady1025/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js) was provided in a JSON format and added as a table to the HTML index file. An [app.js](https://github.com/Lbrady1025/javascript-challenge/blob/main/UFO-level-1/static/js/app.js) file was then added with a function that would grab dates based on user input and filter down UFO sightings based on the input. 

An event watcher was put in place to grab the data that was put into the field and return the results that matched that date.
